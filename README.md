Have you always wanted to become a drummer but dont have the space for a kit of your own? Would your roommates throw you out at the first sign of a drum stick? Look no further than In the Pocket. In the Pocket is an interactive drum set simulator you can use in your browser. Just using your keyboard you can practice using three preset drum kits: Rock, Jazz, and Electronic. If you wish you can also build a custom drum kit from a wide range of our available drums and cymbals. Once you're ready to begin recording your first album you can use our recording feature and hear back your playing.

Project Layout
  - There is a wireframe template of the project located in the assets directory named "project_template.png"
  - You can also follow this link to the wireframe: https://wireframe.cc/xWGU7T

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
  - The drum set and stage will be rendered using canvas.
  - The audio recording and playing capabilities will be done using the Web Audio API or the Howler.js library. Potentially a mix of both.

Implementation Timeline:
  - Friday Afternoon: Create basic functionality, more specifically create working eventListeners for keystrokes and output a sound bite.

  - Weekend: 
    - Saturday: Compile audio files that I will use in the project.
        - Preset kits will be in their own folders in the audio directory.
        - Custom options will be in their own folders as well, based on which drum or cymbal they are to be associated with.
        - Attempt to familiarize myself with the API & Libraries I am using, create working eventHandlers that trigger at least one of the preset kits.
    - Sunday: Begin working on building out a basic template for the website on canvas. Get a simple background and drums/cymbals designed. This may not be the final design.
  - Monday: Get more into the details of assembling the drum kit on the stage. At this point my buttons should work, I would like to be able to select from preset kits by the end of Monday and play on all of them. Animation for the drum kit may not yet be built out here.
  - Tuesday: Build out the animation for the movement of drums when they are struck, focus on front end today. Want to make things look beautiful.
  - Wednesday: Build out the ability to custom assemble a kit to use on the stage. I would also like to build out the ability for the user to record their drum tracks and play them back.
  - Thursday: The project should be done by this point, but this day will be used for any finishing touches I need. Present and be proud!
