In the Pocket is an interactve drumset application, users will be able to:
  - Play a drum set rendered on the page in front of them
  - Select from multiple pre-set drum kits
  - Create a custom drum kit from wide range of options
  - Record your own drum takes on the application

In addition, this project will include:
  - An animated drum kit that moves based on user input.
  - Instructions on how to use this application listed below.

Project Layout
  - There is a wireframe template of the project located in the root directory named "project_template.png"
  - You can also follow this link to the wireframe: https://wireframe.cc/xWGU7T

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
  - The drum set and stage will be rendered using canvas.
  - The audio recording and playing capabilities will be done using the Web Audio API or the Howler.js library. Potentially a mix of both.
  
  <!-- (finish researching this part) -->

Implementation Timeline:
  - Friday Afternoon: Create basic functionality, more specifically create working eventListeners for keystrokes and output a sound bite.

  - Weekend: 
    - Saturday: Compile audio files that I will use in the project.
        - Preset kits will be in their own folders in the audio directory.
        - Custom options will be in their own folders as well, based on which drum or cymbal they are to be associated with.
        - Attempt to familiarize myself with the API & Libraries I am using, create working eventHandlers that trigger at least one of the preset kits.
    - Sunday: Begin working on building out a basic template for the website on canvas. Get a simple background and drums/cymbals designed. This may not be the final design.
  - Monday: Get more into the details of assembling the drum kit on the stage. At this point my buttons should work, I would like to be able to select from preset kits by the end of Monday and play on all of them. Animation for the drum kit may not yet be built out here.
  - Tuesday: Build out the animation for the movement of drums when they are struck, focus on front end today. Want to make things look beautiful.
  - Wednesday: Build out the ability to custom assemble a kit to use on the stage. I would also like to build out the ability for the user to record their drum tracks and play them back.
  - Thursday: The project should be done by this point, but this day will be used for any finishing touches I need. Present and be proud!
